🐪 I have a small project about Livestock trade, from Seller to Butcher.

🎯 this project achive the Publisher Subscribe Design Pattern.

📢 this is good way for anyone has animal farm and wants to sell them or someone wants an animal and for anyone can slaughter the animal.

🛠️ The features are:
1️⃣- Form(Seller):
there is a groupbox, it has subscribe or not for Customer
why add this? because if the customer buys your animal you will know and earn your money, if not you will know about the operation you must Subscribe.

2️⃣- Form(Customer):
there are two of groupbox , they have  subscribe or not for seller and butcher.

👤-For Seller:
 ⭕-Subscribe: You will know about all sellers Animal.
❌-UnSubscribe:you will dont know about all sellers Animal.

🔪-For Butcher:
⭕-Subscribe:You will know about Butchers Bill and Pay the bill.
❌-UnSubscribe: You will dont know about Butchers Bill.

3️⃣-Form(Butcher):
there is a groupbox about Customer, For know about Customer.

⭕Subscribe: You will know about Customers Animal And Earn some money for kill it.
❌-UnSubscribe:You will dont know about Customer`s Animal.
